## TODO

- [x] there is a mistake with discounted rewards, since step 0 is furthest back. Thus, we need to take len - step
- [x] fw.credits.PBest
- [x] fw.credits.GBest
- [x] fw.credits.RBest
- [x] multiple credits together -> sum (bhh)
- [x] fw.credits.Symmetric
- [x] there is a mistake with multiple credits, should not recount observations of heuristics and entities, only sum credit.
- [!!!!!!!!!] loss change average to sum -> This is a problem with SGD
- [ ] log-sum-exp
- [ ] counts -> should start with alpha, priors parameters -> initialisers, see bhh l.58
- [ ] Comment credit source files
- [ ] Comment bhh source files
- [ ] tensorboard selection probabilities
- [ ] tensorboard selections
- [ ] bhh hyper-params on schedule? -> do after Adam with LR decay
- [ ] more datasets
- [ ] more heuristics
- [ ] optimisation
- [ ] training, test, validation
- [ ] main + experiment -> cli
- [ ] ensure all heuristics are always selected, despite model
- [ ] ensure all heuristics prerequisite data are met
- [ ] prepare experiments
- [ ] test scripts
- [ ] access hpc
- [ ] run experiments
- [ ] gather data
- [ ] do statistical analysis
- [ ] prepare results
