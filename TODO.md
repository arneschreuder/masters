## TODO

- [ ] GA
- [ ] DE
- [ ] CMA-ES
- [ ] evaluate all at step 0, allowing an evaluation, before any steps. All losses should start at -ln(1/classes) then.
- [ ] counts -> should start with alpha, priors parameters -> initialisers, see bhh l.58
- [ ] Change check for LR instance to isinstance(lr, Exponential)
- [ ] Comment all files
- [ ] tensorboard selection probabilities
- [ ] tensorboard selections
- [ ] Normalise counts to perhaps cater for mode collapse?
- [ ] Move heuristic code for BHH from optimiser to heuristic
- [ ] cookie cutter datascience
- [ ] more datasets
- [ ] training, test, validation
- [ ] main + experiment -> cli
- [ ] prepare experiments
- [ ] test scripts
- [ ] access hpc
- [ ] run experiments
- [ ] gather data
- [ ] do statistical analysis
- [ ] prepare results

BHH Hyper-Params:
All todo with selection (concentrations, prob dists, counts)
All todo with when selection happens
