- [ ] there is a mistake with discounted rewards, since step 0 is furthest back. Thus, we need to take len - step
- [x] fw.credits.PBest
- [x] fw.credits.GBest
- [x] fw.credits.RBest
- [ ] multiple credits together -> sum (bhh)
- [ ] tensorboard selection probabilities
- [ ] tensorboard selections
- [ ] fw.credits.Random
- [ ] log-sum-exp
- [ ] loss change average to sum
- [ ] more datasets
- [ ] more heuristics
- [ ] optimisation
- [ ] training, test, validation
- [ ] main + experiment -> cli
- [ ] ensure all heuristics are always selected, despite model
- [ ] ensure all heuristics prerequisite data are met
- [ ] prepare experiments
- [ ] test scripts
- [ ] access hpc
- [ ] run experiments
- [ ] gather data
- [ ] do statistical analysis
- [ ] prepare results
