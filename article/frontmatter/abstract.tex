	This work introduces a novel population-based \Acf{BHH}. An empirical study is done by using the \acs{BHH} to train \acsp{FFNN}. An in-depth behaviour analysis is done and the performance of the \acs{BHH} is compared to that of ten popular low-level heuristics, each with different search behaviours. The chosen heuristic pool consists of classic gradient-based heuristics as well as meta-heuristics. The empirical process is executed on fourteen datasets consisting of classification and regression problems with varying characteristics. The \acs{BHH} is shown to be able to train \acsp{FFNN} well and provide an automated method for finding the best heuristic to train the \acsp{FFNN} at various stages of the training process.
