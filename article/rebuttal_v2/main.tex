\begin{reply}
	The authors would like to thank the editor and reviewer again for their comments and the time taken to read the manuscript. All the issues raised by the editor/reviewers are addressed in the following document. A number of grammatical and language improvements have been made, and the references are updated and now capped at 49 as requested. A summary of the changes made is given as follows:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Changed FFNNs to FFNN in the paragraph about the BHH's applicability to different ANN types.

		\item Removed citation ``\citep{ref:zell:1994}'' from the sentence about FFNN topologies.
		\item Removed ``was popularised by \citet{ref:werbos:1994}'' from the sentence about the backpropagation algorithm.
		\item Removed citation ``\citep{ref:gupta:1999}'' from the list of references about meta-heuristics used to train FFNNs.
		\item Changed ``dimensions'' to ``categories'' when describing the classification scheme for hyper-heuristics. Also changed subsequent uses of ``dimension'' to ``category''.
		\item Removed citation ``\citep{ref:dowsland:2007}'' from the list of examples of hyper-heuristics in optimization.
		\item Changed ``not individual heuristic'' to ``not the state of individual heuristics'' when describing what the population state tracks.
		\item Removed citation ``\citep{ref:glorot:2010}'' from the sentence about Glorot uniform sampling for weight initialization.
		\item Removed citations for various statistical tests: Shapiro-Wilk test, Levene's test, ANOVA test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Tukey honest significant difference test.
