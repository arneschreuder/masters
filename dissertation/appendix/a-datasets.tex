\chapter{Datasets}
\label{app:datasets}

Appendices follow exactly the same structure as chapters. They are used to
describe aspects that are not central to the dissertation (for example, an
algorithm that you benchmark against, but do not focus on in the main text, or a
discussion on the sample datasets you test your algorithm on).

\section{Summary}
\label{app:datasets:summary}

As always, provide a summary at the end.
